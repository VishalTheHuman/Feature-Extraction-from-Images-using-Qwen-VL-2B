\[ r = \frac{\text{Width}}{2} = \frac{2.5}{2} = 1.25 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (1.25)^2 (2.5) \]

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi (3.125) (2.5) \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 7.8125\pi \]

Using the approximate value of \( \pi \) as 3.14:

\[ \text{Volume} \approx 7.8125 \times 3.14 \]

\[ \text{Volume} \approx 24.5 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the Celsius Sparkling Orange can is approximately 24.5 cubic inches."

1. **Calculate the volume of one bottle:**

The bottle is a rectangular prism with dimensions:
- Width: 2 cm (from the visible dimensions)
- Depth: 2 cm (from the visible dimensions)
- Height: 2 cm (from the visible dimensions)

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

Substituting the visible dimensions:
\[ V = 2 \, \text{cm} \times 2 \, \text{cm} \times 2 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ V = 8 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

2. **Calculate the volume of the pack:**

Since there are 5 bottles in the pack, we multiply the volume of one bottle by 5:
\[ \text{Volume of the pack} = 5 \times 8 \, \text{cm}^3 \]
\[ \text{Volume of the pack} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

293,119373,"To determine the volume of the product, we need to consider the dimensions of the bottles and the volume of the liquid inside them. The image shows two bottles with a label that indicates the volume of the liquid inside each bottle.

1. **Bottle A (Purple):**
   - Width: 3 inches
   - Depth: 3 inches
   - Height: 7 inches

2. **Bottle B (Orange):**
   - Width: 3 inches
   - Depth: 3 inches
   - Height: 7 inches

The volume of each bottle can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

For Bottle A:
\[ \text{Volume} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 3 \, \text{inches} \times 7 \, \text{inches} = 63 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

For Bottle B:
\[ \text{Volume} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 3 \, \text{inches} \times 7 \, \text{inches} = 63 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since both bottles have the same volume, the total volume of the product is:

305,119385,"The volume of the product can be determined by interpreting the visible dimensions of the bottle. The bottle is cylindrical in shape, and the visible dimensions are the width (750 mL) and the height (approximately 15 cm). 

To calculate the volume, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder (which can be calculated as half the height, \( \frac{h}{2} \)), and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

Given:
- Width (width of the bottle) = 750 mL
- Height (height of the bottle) = 15 cm

First, convert the height from centimeters to meters:
\[ 15 \, \text{cm} = 0.15 \, \text{m} \]

Now, calculate the radius:
\[ r = \frac{h}{2} = \frac{0.15 \, \text{m}}{2} = 0.075 \, \text{m} \]

Now, calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (0.075 \, \text{m})^2 \times 0.15 \, \text{m} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 0.005625 \, \text{m}^2 \times 0.15 \, \text{m} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 0.0084375 \, \text{m}^3 \]

363,119445,"To determine the volume of the product, we need to calculate the volume of the bottle and then multiply it by the number of bottles.

1. **Calculate the volume of the bottle:**
   - The bottle has a width of 5 cm, a depth of 5 cm, and a height of 10 cm.
   - The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the bottle) is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{depth} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the given dimensions:
     \[
     \text{Volume} = 5 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 250 \, \text{cm}^3
     \]

2. **Calculate the volume of the product:**
   - Since there are 100 mL in 1000 mL, we need to find out how many 100 mL bottles fit into 250 cm³.
   - The volume of one bottle is 100 mL.
   - To find out how many bottles fit into 250 cm³:
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{250 \, \text{cm}^3}{100 \, \text{mL/bottle}} = 2.5 \, \text{bottles}
     \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is 250 cm³, and it can be filled by 2.5 bottles."

The bottle is cylindrical, and the visible dimensions are the height (the vertical distance from the top to the bottom of the bottle) and the diameter (the horizontal distance across the bottle). 

Given that the bottle is 750 mL (750 milliliters) tall and has a diameter of 7 cm (7 centimeters), we can calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder (half the diameter), and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

First, we need to find the radius \( r \):

\[ r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{7 \text{ cm}}{2} = 3.5 \text{ cm} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (3.5 \text{ cm})^2 \times 750 \text{ mL} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 12.25 \times 750 \text{ mL} \]

\[ \text{Volume} \approx 911.14 \text{ mL} \]

48,119630,"To determine the volume of the Estrella Jalisco beer bottles, we can use the visible dimensions of the bottles and apply the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the bottle,
- \( h \) is the height of the bottle.

However, since the bottles are shown in a vertical orientation, we can assume that the height \( h \) is equal to the diameter of the bottle. This is a common assumption for beer bottles, as they are typically cylindrical in shape.

Given that the bottles are 12 ounces (12 fl oz) each, we can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

Since the bottles are 12 ounces, we can assume that the diameter is 6 inches (since 12 fl oz is approximately 33.81 fl oz, and 33.81 fl oz is approximately 6 inches in diameter). The radius \( r \) is half the diameter, so:

\[ r = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi (3)^2 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 9 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 9\pi \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 108\pi \]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ \text{Volume} \approx 108 \times 3.14 \]
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 339.12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the Estrella Jalisco beer bottles is approximately 339.12 cubic inches."

51,119633,"To determine the volume of the Pedialyte AdvancedCare with Immune Support Electrolyte Solution, we need to calculate the volume of one bottle and then multiply it by the number of bottles in the package.

1. **Volume of one bottle:**
   - The Pedialyte AdvancedCare with Immune Support Electrolyte Solution is 33.8 fluid ounces (1.05 quarts).
   - Since there are 33.8 fluid ounces in 1 quart, the volume of one bottle is:
     \[
     \frac{33.8 \text{ fluid ounces}}{1 \text{ quart}} = 33.8 \text{ fluid ounces}
     \]

2. **Volume of the package:**
   - The Pedialyte AdvancedCare with Immune Support Electrolyte Solution is packaged in a 4-pack.
   - Therefore, the total volume of the package is:
     \[
     33.8 \text{ fluid ounces} \times 4 = 135.2 \text{ fluid ounces}
     \]

3. **Volume of the package in cubic inches:**
   - Since 1 cubic inch is equal to 1 fluid ounce, the volume of the package in cubic inches is:
     \[
     135.2 \text{ fluid ounces} \times 1 \text{ cubic inch/fluid ounce} = 135.2 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

So, the volume of the Pedialyte AdvancedCare with Immune Support Electrolyte Solution in the package is 135.2 cubic inches."

100,119682,"To determine the volume of each bottle, we need to calculate the volume of the liquid inside the bottle. Since the bottles are filled to the brim, we can assume that the volume of the liquid is equal to the volume of the bottle.

Here are the dimensions of the bottles:

- Width: 5 cm (1 cm = 10 mm)
- Depth: 5 cm (1 cm = 10 mm)
- Height: 10 cm (1 cm = 10 mm)

The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the bottles) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 5 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 250 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Since the bottles are filled to the brim, the volume of the liquid inside each bottle is equal to the volume of the bottle itself. Therefore, the volume of each bottle is:

211,119793,The product's item weight is not explicitly indicated in the image.
212,119794,"The volume of the product can be determined by interpreting the visible dimensions of the bottle. The bottle is cylindrical, and we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

From the image, we can see the following dimensions:
- The height of the bottle is approximately 15 cm.
- The diameter of the base of the bottle is approximately 7.5 cm.

First, we need to find the radius \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{7.5}{2} = 3.75 \, \text{cm} \]

Now we can calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (3.75)^2 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 13.5625 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 218.75\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 218.75 \times 3.14 \]
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 684.25 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is approximately 684.25 cubic centimeters."
213,119795,"The volume of the product can be determined by interpreting the visible dimensions. The can is 12 fluid ounces (oz) tall and has a diameter of 2 inches. The volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the can) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder (half the diameter), and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

Given:
- Diameter of the can = 2 inches
- Height of the can = 12 inches

First, calculate the radius:
\[ r = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Diameter} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Now, calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h = \pi \times (1)^2 \times 12 = 12\pi \text{ cubic inches} \]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 12 \times 3.14 = 37.68 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is approximately 37.68 cubic inches."

283,119865,"To determine the volume of the product, we need to consider the dimensions of the packaging and any visible dimensions that can be used to estimate the volume.

1. **Width and Depth**: The packaging is rectangular, and we can estimate the width and depth from the visible dimensions.
2. **Height**: The height of the packaging is not explicitly given, but we can estimate it based on the visible dimensions.

Given the visible dimensions:
- Width: 11 inches
- Depth: 3 inches

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the packaging) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

Plugging in the dimensions:
\[ V = 11 \, \text{inches} \times 3 \, \text{inches} \times \text{Estimated Height} \]

Since the height is not explicitly given, we can estimate it based on the visible dimensions:
\[ \text{Estimated Height} = \frac{\text{Width} \times \text{Depth}}{\text{Width}} = \frac{11 \, \text{inches} \times 3 \, \text{inches}}{11 \, \text{inches}} = 3 \, \text{inches} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume:
\[ V = 11 \, \text{inches} \times 3 \, \text{inches} \times 3 \, \text{inches} = 99 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is approximately 99 cubic inches."

318,119900,"To determine the volume of the Black Box Premium Wines Merlot, we need to calculate the volume of the box and then multiply it by the number of bottles it contains.

1. **Calculate the volume of the box:**
   - The box is a rectangular prism.
   - The visible dimensions of the box are:
     - Width: 13 inches
     - Depth: 13 inches
     - Height: 13 inches

   The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height}
   \]

   Substituting the given dimensions:
   \[
   V = 13 \, \text{inches} \times 13 \, \text{inches} \times 13 \, \text{inches}
   \]

   \[
   V = 2197 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the volume of the product:**
   - The product is a 13L box.
   - The volume of the product \( V_{\text{product}} \) is:
     \[
     V_{\text{product}} = 13 \, \text{L}
     \]

3. **Calculate the volume of the product per bottle:**
   - The box contains 4 bottles.
   - The volume of one bottle \( V_{\text{bottle}} \) is:
     \[
     V_{\text{bottle}} = \frac{V_{\text{product}}}{4}
     \]

   Substituting the volume of the product:
   \[
   V_{\text{bottle}} = \frac{13 \, \text{L}}{4}
   \]

   \[
   V_{\text{bottle}} = 3.25 \, \text{L}
   \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is 2197 cubic inches, and the volume of the product per bottle is 3.25 liters."

- The bottle is cylindrical.
- The visible height of the bottle is approximately 2.5 cm (1 inch).

To calculate the volume of the bottle, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

Given:
- \( r = 1 \) cm (half the diameter)
- \( h = 2.5 \) cm

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi (1)^2 (2.5) = \pi \times 2.5 \]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\):

1. **Width and Depth**: The bottle is 500 milliliters (mL) in diameter and 16.9 milliliters (mL) in height.
2. **Height of the Box**: The box is 12 bottles deep, so the total height of the box is 12 * 16.9 mL = 205.8 mL.

Now, we can calculate the volume of one bottle by multiplying the width and depth:

\[ \text{Volume of one bottle} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one bottle} = 500 \, \text{mL} \times 16.9 \, \text{mL} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one bottle} = 8450 \, \text{mL} \]

Since there are 12 bottles in the box, the total volume of the product is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = \text{Volume of one bottle} \times \text{Number of bottles} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 8450 \, \text{mL} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 101400 \, \text{mL} \]

The can is cylindrical and has a visible height of approximately 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) and a diameter of approximately 2.5 inches (6.4 cm). The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

477,120059,"To determine the volume of the suspension grease can, we need to consider the dimensions provided on the label. The label indicates that the can contains 14 fluid ounces (fl oz) or 400 grams.

Here are the visible dimensions:
- Width: 1.5 inches
- Depth: 1.5 inches
- Height: 7.5 inches

To calculate the volume, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

Given that the radius \( r \) is half the width, we have:
\[ r = \frac{1.5 \text{ inches}}{2} = 0.75 \text{ inches} \]

The height \( h \) is given as 7.5 inches.

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi (0.75)^2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 0.5625 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 4.21875 \]
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 13.85 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the suspension grease can is approximately 13.85 cubic inches."

485,120067,"To determine the volume of the hand sanitizer bottles, we need to consider the visible dimensions of the bottles and any additional dimensions that might be relevant to the product's volume.

1. **Height**: The bottles are standing upright, and the visible height is approximately 2 inches (50 mm).
2. **Width**: The width of the bottles is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the visible dimensions. The bottles are approximately 1 inch (25 mm) wide.
3. **Depth**: The depth of the bottles is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the visible dimensions. The bottles are approximately 1 inch (25 mm) deep.

Given these dimensions, the volume of each bottle can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Height} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \, \text{inches} \times 1 \, \text{inch} \times 1 \, \text{inch} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of each bottle is 2 cubic inches."
