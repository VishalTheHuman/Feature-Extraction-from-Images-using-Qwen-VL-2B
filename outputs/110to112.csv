- Width: 17 inches
- Depth: 5 inches
- Height: 17 inches

The volume of the bottle can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 17 \, \text{inches} \times 5 \, \text{inches} \times 17 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 17 \times 5 \times 17 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 17^2 \times 5 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 289 \times 5 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1445 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the Sparkling Ice Strawberry Lemonade is 1445 cubic inches."
110005,"To determine the volume of the product, we need to consider the dimensions of the packaging and any visible dimensions on the labels. The labels on the bottles indicate the volume of the product.

1. **Width and Depth**: The width of the packaging is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the visible dimensions of the bottles. The bottles are vertically oriented, and the visible part of the packaging is approximately 10 cm wide.

2. **Height**: The height of the packaging is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the visible dimensions of the bottles. The bottles are vertically oriented, and the visible part of the packaging is approximately 10 cm high.

Given these dimensions, we can calculate the volume of the product by multiplying the width by the depth and then by the height.

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

   - Depth: 2 inches
   - Height: 2 inches
   - Volume = Width × Depth × Height = 2 inches × 2 inches × 2 inches = 8 cubic inches

5. **Applelicious (rightmost)**
   - Width: 2 inches
   - Depth: 2 inches
   - Height: 2 inches
   - Volume = Width × Depth × Height = 2 inches × 2 inches × 2 inches = 8 cubic inches

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

From the image, we can see the following dimensions:
- The height of the bottle is approximately 15 cm.
- The diameter of the base of the bottle is approximately 7 cm.

First, we need to find the radius \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{7 \text{ cm}}{2} = 3.5 \text{ cm} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (3.5 \text{ cm})^2 \times 15 \text{ cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 12.25 \text{ cm}^2 \times 15 \text{ cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 196.25 \pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

Using the approximate value of \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 196.25 \times 3.14 \text{ cm}^3 \]
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 628.63 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is approximately 628.63 cubic centimeters."

110557,"To determine the volume of the product, we need to calculate the volume of each container based on its dimensions. The dimensions provided are:

- Width: 20L
- Depth: 20L
- Height: 20L

The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the containers) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

Let's calculate the volume for each container:

1. **10L Container:**
   \[ \text{Volume} = 20L \times 20L \times 20L = 8000L^3 \]

2. **20L Container:**
   \[ \text{Volume} = 20L \times 20L \times 20L = 8000L^3 \]

3. **5L Container:**
   \[ \text{Volume} = 20L \times 20L \times 20L = 8000L^3 \]

4. **10L Container:**
   \[ \text{Volume} = 20L \times 20L \times 20L = 8000L^3 \]

5. **20L Container:**
   \[ \text{Volume} = 20L \times 20L \times 20L = 8000L^3 \]

6. **5L Container:**
   \[ \text{Volume} = 20L \times 20L \times 20L = 8000L^3 \]

So, the volumes of the products are:
- 10L Container: 8000L^3
- 20L Container: 8000L^3
- 5L Container: 8000L^3
- 10L Container: 8000L^3

110677,"To determine the volume of the Hollywood Enriched Gold Peanut Oil bottle, we need to consider the visible dimensions and any implied dimensions based on the bottle's shape.

1. **Width and Depth**: The bottle is rectangular, with a visible width of 2.5 inches and a depth of 2.5 inches.
2. **Height**: The bottle appears to be a standard bottle shape, with a height of 7.5 inches.

Given these dimensions, we can calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 2.5 \, \text{inches} \times 2.5 \, \text{inches} \times 7.5 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 18.75 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since 1 cubic inch is equal to 1 fluid ounce, the volume of the bottle is:

\[ 18.75 \, \text{cubic inches} = 18.75 \, \text{fluid ounces} \]

Therefore, the Hollywood Enriched Gold Peanut Oil bottle has a volume of 18.75 fluid ounces."

110688,"To determine the volume of the product, we need to consider the dimensions of the can and the volume of the liquid inside the can.

1. **Width and Depth**: The can is 12 fl oz (355 mL) tall.
2. **Height**: The can is 5.5 inches tall.

The volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the can) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

Given that the can is 5.5 inches tall and the volume is 355 mL, we can use the formula to find the radius:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]
\[ 355 mL = \pi r^2 \times 5.5 \]
\[ r^2 = \frac{355 mL}{\pi \times 5.5} \]
\[ r^2 = \frac{355}{\pi} \]
\[ r^2 \approx 11.34 \]
\[ r \approx \sqrt{11.34} \]
\[ r \approx 3.35 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume using the radius:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times (3.35)^2 \times 5.5 \]
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 355 mL \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is approximately 355 mL."

1. **USB-C Ports:**
   - There are two USB-C ports.
   - Each USB-C port has a weight of approximately 0.1 kg.
   - Total weight for two ports: \( 2 \times 0.1 \, \text{kg} = 0.2 \, \text{kg} \).

110732,"The volume of the product can be determined by interpreting the visible dimensions of the bottle. The bottle appears to be cylindrical in shape. 

- Width: The visible width of the bottle is approximately 2 inches.
- Depth: The visible depth of the bottle is approximately 2 inches.
- Height: The visible height of the bottle is approximately 4 inches.

To calculate the volume, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder (which is the width of the bottle), and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder (which is the height of the bottle).

Given that the width is 2 inches and the height is 4 inches, we can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times (2 \text{ inches})^2 \times 4 \text{ inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 4 \text{ inches}^2 \times 4 \text{ inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 16\pi \text{ cubic inches} \]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\), we get:

\[ \text{Volume} \approx 16 \times 3.14 \text{ cubic inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 50.24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is approximately 50.24 cubic inches."

Given that the bottles are rectangular and the dimensions are visible, we can assume that the width and depth are the same for all bottles. Let's assume the width is \( w \) and the depth is \( d \).

Since the bottles are 16 ml each, we can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = w \times d \times 16 \]

Without specific dimensions, we cannot calculate the exact volume. However, if we assume that the bottles are 16 ml each, we can calculate the volume for one bottle:

\[ \text{Volume} = 16 \times 16 \times 16 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 256 \times 16 \]

110920,"The volume of the product can be determined by interpreting the visible dimensions. The bottle is cylindrical and has a visible width of 2 cm and a depth of 1 cm. The height of the bottle is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the visible dimensions.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

Given:
- Width (\( w \)) = 2 cm
- Depth (\( d \)) = 1 cm
- Height (\( h \)) = unknown

We can use the visible dimensions to estimate the height. Since the bottle is cylindrical, the height can be approximated as the difference between the visible width and depth:
\[ h \approx w - d \]
\[ h \approx 2 cm - 1 cm \]
\[ h \approx 1 cm \]

Now we can calculate the volume:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
\[ V = \pi (2 cm)^2 (1 cm) \]
\[ V = \pi (4 cm^2) (1 cm) \]
\[ V = 4\pi cm^3 \]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
\[ V \approx 4 \times 3.14 \, cm^3 \]
\[ V \approx 12.56 \, cm^3 \]

110927,"To determine the volume of the product, we need to consider the dimensions of the bottle and the volume of the liquid inside it. The bottle is described as a ""15 oz. 450 ml."" bottle, which means it contains 15 ounces (oz) of liquid and 450 milliliters (ml).

1. **Volume of the bottle**: 15 oz
2. **Volume of the liquid**: 450 ml

To find the total volume of the product, we add the volume of the bottle to the volume of the liquid:
\[ \text{Total volume} = \text{Volume of the bottle} + \text{Volume of the liquid} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 450 \, \text{ml} \]

Since 1 oz is equal to 30 ml, we can convert the volume of the liquid to ounces:
\[ 450 \, \text{ml} = 450 \times 30 \, \text{ml} = 13500 \, \text{ml} \]

Now, we add the volume of the bottle to the volume of the liquid:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]
\[ \text{Total volume} = 15 \, \text{oz} + 13500 \, \text{ml} \]

110943,"To determine the volume of the neutral pH adhesive, we need to calculate the volume based on the visible dimensions of the bottles.

1. **4 oz bottle:**
   - Width: 2 inches
   - Depth: 2 inches
   - Height: 4 inches
   - Volume = Width × Depth × Height = 2 inches × 2 inches × 4 inches = 16 cubic inches

2. **8 oz bottle:**
   - Width: 2 inches
   - Depth: 2 inches
   - Height: 8 inches
   - Volume = Width × Depth × Height = 2 inches × 2 inches × 8 inches = 32 cubic inches

3. **1 Quart bottle:**
   - Width: 2 inches
   - Depth: 2 inches
   - Height: 4 quarts (since 1 quart = 4 quarts)
   - Volume = Width × Depth × Height = 2 inches × 2 inches × 4 quarts = 16 cubic quarts

4. **1 Gallon bottle:**
   - Width: 2 inches
   - Depth: 2 inches
   - Height: 8 gallons (since 1 gallon = 8 gallons)
   - Volume = Width × Depth × Height = 2 inches × 2 inches × 8 gallons = 32 cubic gallons

Now, let's convert the volume from cubic inches to cubic quarts and cubic gallons:

- **4 oz bottle:**
  - Volume = 16 cubic inches
  - 16 cubic inches = 16 cubic quarts
  - 16 cubic quarts = 1 gallon

- **8 oz bottle:**
  - Volume = 32 cubic inches
  - 32 cubic inches = 32 cubic quarts
  - 32 cubic quarts = 4 gallons

- **1 Quart bottle:**
  - Volume = 16 cubic quarts
  - 16 cubic quarts = 1 gallon

- **1 Gallon bottle:**
  - Volume = 32 cubic gallons
  - 32 cubic gallons = 1 gallon

So, the volumes of the neutral pH adhesive are:
- 4 oz bottle: 1 gallon
- 8 oz bottle: 4 gallons
- 1 Quart bottle: 1 gallon
- 1 Gallon bottle: 1 gallon"

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

However, since we don't have explicit dimensions for the cooler or the bottles, we can use the visible dimensions to estimate the volume.

1. **Width of the cooler**: 12 inches
2. **Depth of the cooler**: 12 inches
3. **Height of the cooler**: 12 inches

The volume of the cooler can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Volume of cooler} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of cooler} = 12 \, \text{inches} \times 12 \, \text{inches} \times 12 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume of cooler} = 1728 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since the bottles are cylindrical, we can estimate their volume by assuming they are similar in shape to the cooler. The volume of a cylinder can also be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

However, without specific dimensions for the bottles, we cannot accurately calculate their volume. We can only estimate the volume of the cooler based on the visible dimensions.

Given the dimensions of the cooler, the volume of the cooler is approximately 1728 cubic inches."

1. **Red Bottle:**
   - Width: 3.8 inches
   - Depth: 3.8 inches
   - Height: 10.5 inches

2. **Yellow Bottle:**
   - Width: 3.8 inches
   - Depth: 3.8 inches
   - Height: 10.5 inches

3. **Blue Bottle:**
   - Width: 3.8 inches
   - Depth: 3.8 inches
   - Height: 10.5 inches

4. **Green Bottle:**
   - Width: 3.8 inches

   - Height: 10.5 inches

6. **Yellow Bottle:**
   - Width: 3.8 inches
   - Depth: 3.8 inches
   - Height: 10.5 inches

From the visible dimensions, we can infer that the volume of each bottle is approximately 1.8 liters (1.8 cubic feet). This is because the dimensions are given in inches and the volume is given in liters, and the conversion factor from cubic inches to cubic feet is approximately 0.004378 cubic feet per cubic inch.

Therefore, the volume of each bottle is approximately 1.8 liters."

The bottle is 11 inches tall, which is approximately 28 cm. Given that the bottle is 28 cm wide, we can estimate the volume by multiplying the width by the height:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 28 \, \text{cm} \times 11 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 308 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the bottle is approximately 308 cubic inches."

111160,"The volume of the wine bottle can be determined by interpreting the visible dimensions. The bottle is cylindrical, and we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

From the image, we can see the following dimensions:
- The height \( h \) is approximately 750 millimeters (mm).
- The diameter of the base of the cylinder is approximately 150 mm.

First, we need to find the radius \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{diameter}{2} = \frac{150 \, \text{mm}}{2} = 75 \, \text{mm} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (75 \, \text{mm})^2 (750 \, \text{mm}) \approx 3.14159 \times 5625 \times 750 \, \text{mm}^3 \approx 1,159,400 \, \text{mm}^3 \]

111314,"The volume of the product can be determined by interpreting the visible dimensions of the bottle. The bottle is cylindrical, and we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

From the image, we can see the following dimensions:
- The height of the bottle is approximately 15 cm.
- The diameter of the base of the bottle is approximately 7 cm.

First, we need to find the radius \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{7 \text{ cm}}{2} = 3.5 \text{ cm} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (3.5 \text{ cm})^2 \times 15 \text{ cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 12.25 \text{ cm}^2 \times 15 \text{ cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 196.25 \pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

Using the approximate value of \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 196.25 \times 3.14 \text{ cm}^3 \]
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 628.41 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is approximately 628.41 cubic centimeters."

111533,"The volume of the product can be determined by interpreting the visible dimensions of the bottle. The bottle is cylindrical, and we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

From the image, we can see the following dimensions:
- The height of the bottle is approximately 187 millimeters (7 inches).
- The diameter of the bottle is approximately 75 millimeters (3 inches).

First, we need to find the radius:
\[ \text{Radius} = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{75 \text{ mm}}{2} = 37.5 \text{ mm} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi (37.5 \text{ mm})^2 \times 75 \text{ mm} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times 1331.25 \text{ mm}^3 \]
\[ \text{Volume} \approx 4148.62 \text{ mm}^3 \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is approximately 4148.62 cubic millimeters."

- Width: 10 inches
- Depth: 10 inches
- Height: 10 inches

Since the label does not provide explicit dimensions for width, depth, or height, we can infer that the dimensions are likely the same as the visible dimensions. Therefore, the volume of the product is 1.8 liters.

To convert the volume from liters to gallons, we use the conversion factor: 1 liter = 0.26417 gallons.

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = \frac{\text{Volume in liters}}{\text{Conversion factor}} \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = \frac{1.8 \text{ liters}}{0.26417 \text{ gallons/liter}} \]

111596,"To determine the volume of the energy drink can, we need to consider the dimensions of the can and the volume of the can itself. The can is typically cylindrical in shape, and the volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

However, since the can is not a perfect cylinder, we can estimate the volume by considering the dimensions of the can. The can is typically 12 fl oz (355 mL) in volume, which is a common size for energy drinks.

Given that the can is 12 fl oz (355 mL) in volume, we can use this information to estimate the dimensions of the can. The volume of the can is given by:

\[ \text{Volume} = 12 \, \text{fl oz} = 355 \, \text{mL} \]

To estimate the dimensions of the can, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi r^2 h \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

Since we know the volume is 355 mL, we can rearrange the formula to solve for either the radius or the height:

\[ 355 \, \text{mL} = \pi r^2 h \]

\[ h = \frac{355 \, \text{mL}}{\pi r^2} \]

Without specific dimensions for the can, we cannot calculate the exact radius and height. However, we can estimate the dimensions based on the volume and the common size of energy drinks.

Given that the can is 12 fl oz (355 mL) in volume, we can estimate the dimensions as follows:

- The height \( h \) of the can is approximately:

\[ h \approx \frac{355 \, \text{mL}}{\pi \times (12 \, \text{fl oz})^2} \]

\[ h \approx \frac{355 \, \text{mL}}{3.14 \times (12 \, \text{fl oz})^2} \]

\[ h \approx \frac{355 \, \text{mL}}{3.14 \times 144 \, \text{fl oz}^2} \]

\[ h \approx \frac{355 \, \text{mL}}{452.16 \, \text{fl oz}^2} \]

\[ h \approx 0.078 \, \text{fl oz} \]

- The radius \( r \) of the can is approximately:

\[ r \approx \sqrt{\frac{355 \, \text{mL}}{\pi \times (12 \, \text{fl oz})^2}} \]

\[ r \approx \sqrt{\frac{355 \, \text{mL}}{3.14 \times 144 \, \text{fl oz}^2}} \]

\[ r \approx \sqrt{\frac{355 \, \text{mL}}{452.16 \, \text{fl oz}^2}} \]

\[ r \approx 0.05 \, \text{fl oz} \]

So, the estimated dimensions of the can are:

- Height: approximately 0.078 fl oz
- Radius: approximately 0.05 fl oz

These are approximate estimates based on the volume and common dimensions of energy drinks."

Given:
- Length = 50 ml (50 milliliters)
- Width = 1.7 fl oz (1.7 fluid ounces)
- Height = 50 ml (50 milliliters)

1. **Width and Depth**: The bottle is a rectangular prism with a width of 3 inches and a depth of 2 inches.
2. **Height**: The bottle is a cylinder with a height of 8 inches.

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{depth} \times \text{height} \]

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height.

Since the bottle is a cylinder, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

However, we don't have the radius directly. We can use the visible dimensions to estimate the radius. The visible dimensions suggest that the bottle is approximately 3 inches wide and 2 inches deep. The height of the bottle is 8 inches.

Let's calculate the volume using the visible dimensions:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
\[ V = \pi (3 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (9 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (81 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (6561 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (524801 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (419,440,000 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (32,768,000,000 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (2,598,400,000,000 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (2,097,152,000,000,000 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (16,728,000,000,000,000 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]
\[ V = \pi (1,409,600,000,000,000,000 \text{ inches})^2 (8 \text{ inches}) \]

111698,"The product is a bottle of Don Julio Blanco Tequila. The visible dimensions of the bottle are as follows:

- Width: 750 millimeters (mm)
- Depth: 750 millimeters (mm)
- Height: 150 millimeters (mm)

To determine the volume of the bottle, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the bottle):

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ \text{Volume} = 750 \, \text{mm} \times 750 \, \text{mm} \times 150 \, \text{mm} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1,175,000 \, \text{mm}^3 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1,175 \, \text{liters} \]

Therefore, the volume of the Don Julio Blanco Tequila bottle is 1,175 liters."

111701,"To determine the volume of the Oil-Dri Premium Absorbent bag, we need to consider the dimensions of the bag and use the formula for calculating volume:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]

From the image, we can see the following dimensions:
- Length: 32 Quarts
- Width: 35.24 Litters
- Height: 24 inches

First, we need to convert the width from liters to quarts since the length is given in quarts. There are 1000 liters in a gallon and 4 quarts in a gallon, so:
\[ 35.24 \, \text{Litters} = 35.24 \times 1000 \, \text{quarts} = 35240 \, \text{quarts} \]

Now, we can calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = 32 \, \text{Quarts} \times 35240 \, \text{quarts} \times 24 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 32 \times 35240 \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 10409600 \, \text{quarts} \]

Therefore, the volume of the Oil-Dri Premium Absorbent bag is 1040,9600 quarts."

- Width: 2.62 inches (6.65 cm)
- Depth: 2.62 inches (6.65 cm)
- Height: 11.19 inches (28.3 cm)

To determine the volume of the product, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \times \text{Height} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ \text{Volume} = 2.62 \, \text{inches} \times 2.62 \, \text{inches} \times 11.19 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 70.00 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of the product is 70.00 cubic inches."
